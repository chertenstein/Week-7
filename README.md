# Week-7
For my final assignment, I had two ideas.
1) to create a page for my personal music. I have a few social media sites I could
link to but I don't have any databases to call from (if we need that for the final).
I think it could be interesting but I don't know if it would cover all the requirements.
2) I'm going to a few events coming up around the Lansing area and I thought creating a page
where all the information for said events could be useful. I thought about calling to a
weather page to keep the weather in mind as well as calling to other sites for the
tickets and other information needed.
I'm not really sure which one to go with. I'd like it to be something that is
semi-easy enough to wrap my head around.
